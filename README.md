# Job Market Data Analysis



## Background & Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of **the Canadian job market** trends for data-related roles [using SQL and Excel]. The dataset, collected from **Glassdoor**, includes job postings from **January 1‚Äì31, 2025**, covering six key roles:  
‚Ä¢	**Business Analyst**  
‚Ä¢	**Data Analyst**  
‚Ä¢	**Data Engineer**  
‚Ä¢	**Data Scientist**  
‚Ä¢	**Cloud Engineer**  
‚Ä¢	**Machine Learning (ML) Engineer**  
The analysis utilizes SQL for data extraction and transformation and Excel for visualization through an interactive dashboard.

## Data Structure Overview  
The dataset was manually extracted from Glassdoor to ensure high accuracy and structured formatting, avoiding limitations associated with automated scraping. AI-driven categorization was then applied to classify job attributes, including:

- üîπ **Job Title**  
- üí∞ **Salary**  
- üìç **Location**  
- üè¢ **Company**  
- üíª **Work Mode**  
- üìÖ **Posting Date**  
- ‚è∞ **Job Schedule**  
- üìà **Job Level**  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Required Skills**

This hybrid approach‚Äîcombining human oversight with AI-driven tagging‚Äîensured data integrity, reduced inconsistencies, and created a well-structured dataset. The result is a comprehensive dataset representing the Canadian job market for data professionals as of January 2025.


## Executive Summary
An analysis of 2,385 job postings from January 2025 reveals that Business Analysts (36.3%) & Data Analysts (29.5%) are the most in-demand roles, reflecting their accessibility and widespread industry applications. Cloud Engineers & ML Engineers earn the highest salaries, but these roles require more advanced skills & experience.   
The financial sector, led by TD, Scotiabank, RBC, and CIBC, emerges as a dominant employer, reflecting ongoing investments in data, cloud, and ML expertise.
Geographical trends show Ontario leading in job postings, followed by Quebec and British Columbia, with Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver as key hiring hubs. 
Mid & senior-level positions dominate analyst roles, while entry-level opportunities are more limited for engineering & data science roles, indicating a higher barrier to entry.  
Despite the rise of hybrid work (37%), fully remote roles remain scarce (6%).   
Regarding technical skills, SQL, Python, and Excel dominate employer demand, while Azure, AWS, and Power BI are critical for competitive advantage.

## Insights Deep Dive 
### Role Demand & Salary Trends  
BA and DA roles make up over 65% of job postings, making them the most accessible paths into data careers. Their demand is driven by the need for data interpretation and business insights, requiring skills in SQL, Excel, and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.
ML and Cloud Engineers earn the highest salaries, reflecting the advanced expertise required. These roles demand strong programming skills, cloud computing knowledge, and experience with AI/ML frameworks, making them competitive but rewarding career paths.
Top Employers & Industry Trends  
Canada‚Äôs major banks (TD, Scotiabank, RBC, CIBC) are actively hiring data professionals, reflecting a strong investment in digital transformation.
### Geographical Distribution  
Ontario dominates (1,435 job postings), followed by Quebec (254) and British Columbia (246). Toronto remains the primary tech hub, while smaller provinces show emerging tech job growth.
### Skills Demand  
Across all job postings, SQL, Python, and Excel emerge as the most sought-after skills, forming the foundation for data-related roles. Data visualization expertise is also in high demand, with Power BI and Tableau leading as the preferred tools for business intelligence and reporting.
Breaking down skill requirements further, SQL-based databases dominate, with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL leading in demand, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB are relevant for scalable applications. In programming, SQL and Python remain essential, followed by R for statistical analysis. Additionally, cloud proficiency extends beyond platforms to specialized tools like Databricks and Snowflake, which are crucial for big data processing and cloud-based analytics. Visualization remains a key focus, with Power BI's Microsoft integration and Tableau‚Äôs flexibility making both tools essential for data professionals
### Work Models & Entry Barriers  
Hybrid work (37%) is relatively common, but fully remote roles remain rare (6%). Analyst roles have lower barriers to entry, while Engineering and Data Science positions demand more specialized expertise.
### Career Entry & Progression  
Analyst roles (BA & DA) are the most accessible, with demand concentrated at Mid and Senior levels, while Engineering and Data Science positions have fewer entry-level opportunities, indicating a higher barrier to entry.

## Recommendations
### For Job Seekers  
Prioritize SQL, Python, and cloud computing (Azure, AWS) to maximize employability in Canada‚Äôs competitive job market. Business and Data Analyst roles offer easier entry points, while ML and Cloud Engineering require more specialized training.  
### For Employers    
Expanding remote work opportunities could help attract a larger talent pool, especially for highly skilled roles. Additionally, offering more entry-level and internship roles in Engineering and Data Science would help build a sustainable pipeline of talent.  
### For Career Planning    
Developing expertise in Power BI, Tableau, and database systems (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL) will enhance job prospects in data analysis and business intelligence roles. For those aiming at engineering and cloud roles, hands-on experience with Snowflake, Databricks, and cloud platforms will be a strong differentiator.
